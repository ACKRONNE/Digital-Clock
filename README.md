+ Digital clock with the PIC16F84A Microcontroller which has serial communication.

+ Proteus 8 was used for the simulation, the Pic code was developed in Assembler

+ The interface that is shown in the serial communication was developed in python using the Pyserial library, it obtains the clock data and shows it in a graphical interface.

+ For the serial connection, the RS232 interface was used.
